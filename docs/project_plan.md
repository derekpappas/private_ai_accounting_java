File reading & dynamic data handling

üóÇÔ∏è Organized & Coherent Project Breakdown

üöÄ High-Level Flow
1. Entities Overview:
Entity

Company
id, name, corporation_type, contact_person_id, bank_info_ids[]
Contact Person
id, name, email, phone
Bank Info
id, bank_name, account_type, last_4_digits, company_id
Credit Card
id, card_type, last_4_digits, company_id
Files
id, filename, type (PDF/CSV/etc.), account_id or card_id, uploaded_at, file_path
Transactions
Dynamic structure based on CSVs; linked to file_id


üåü Screens (Frontend Components):

1. Company Management Page:
List of companies ‚Üí create/edit/delete company
Fields:
Company Name
Corporation Type
Contact Person (select/create)
Displays all banks/accounts linked to each company

2. Contact Person Page:
Simple CRUD for contact person info.

3. Bank account Management Page:
Shows all banks/accounts in a table.
Pulldown: Select from existing banks OR create a new one.
Pulldown: Account Type (Checking, Savings, etc.)
Enter Last 4 Digits.
Links to Company via ID.

4. Credit Card account Page:
Similar to Bank Info, no account type.
Enter Card Type (Visa, MasterCard, etc.), last 4 digits.
Link to Company.

5. File Upload Page:
For each Bank or Credit Card, display:
Company Info
Bank Info
Upload files (up to 12 per account)
Auto-link files to account
Accepts PDFs, CSVs, etc.

6. Intermediate Screen (Summary View):
List all Accounts ‚Üí Account Type ‚Üí Bank Name ‚Üí # of files uploaded.
Add/Edit/Delete accounts inline.
Option to Add Another Account ‚Üí loops back.

7. Master Summary Screen:
Lists all Bank Accounts & Credit Cards, showing:
Last 4 digits
Account/Card Type
Company they belong to
Number of uploaded statements/files
Edit/Delete functionality

8. File Processing Overview Page:
At the top: Company Name + Bank Info
Tables per file type/source:
CSV Transactions Table: Read and parse CSV, show transactions (columns may vary! Dynamically render columns)
PDF Statements: Just list filenames uploaded.
Display # of files per source.
Each row = individual transaction/statement file.

9. Transactions Page (Per Account):
Displays list of transactions from parsed files.
At top: Company Name, Bank Name, Account Info.
Supports different column formats per file.
Transactions linked to account.

‚öôÔ∏è Backend System Outline:
Database:


Companies, Contact Persons, Banks, Credit Cards, Files, Transactions tables.
Clear FK relations:
Bank Info ‚Üí Company
Credit Card ‚Üí Company
Files ‚Üí Account/Credit Card
Transactions ‚Üí File
File Upload API:


Handles multipart file uploads.
Stores file metadata in DB.
Reads CSV ‚Üí parses & stores transactions.
For PDFs, stores metadata only (no parsing yet).

üîÑ Technologies Suggested:
Layer
Suggested Tech
Frontend
React + AG Grid for editable tables, Material UI for forms, File Upload components
Backend
Spring Boot (Java) with REST API OR Node.js (Express) depending on preference
Database
PostgreSQL (ideal for relational structure)
File Storage
Local storage OR AWS S3 buckets
InfluxDB
Log file uploads, processing times, etc.


üìÑ File Reading Logic:
Upload:


Upload CSV/PDF ‚Üí backend stores file and creates DB entry.
CSV Parsing:


Parse CSV dynamically ‚Üí extract columns, read all rows.
Store in Transactions table, allowing flexible columns (JSON format, or a wide column design).
PDFs:


Store filename & account association only (for now).


üè∑Ô∏è Card Type Enum
Common Card Types to Include:
VISA
MASTERCARD
AMEX
DISCOVER
OTHER (optional fallback)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Java Backend Example (Spring Boot)
Java Enum:
public enum CardType {
    VISA,
    MASTERCARD,
    AMEX,
    DISCOVER,
    OTHER
}
Usage in CreditCard Entity:
@Entity
public class CreditCard {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private CardType cardType;

    private String last4Digits;

    @ManyToOne
    private Company company;

    // Other fields...
}

2Ô∏è‚É£ Database Enum (PostgreSQL Example):
CREATE TYPE card_type AS ENUM ('VISA', 'MASTERCARD', 'AMEX', 'DISCOVER', 'OTHER');

CREATE TABLE credit_cards (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    card_type card_type,
    last4_digits VARCHAR(4),
    company_id INT
    -- other fields...
);

3Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Usage (React + TypeScript):
export enum CardType {
  VISA = "VISA",
  MASTERCARD = "MASTERCARD",
  AMEX = "AMEX",
  DISCOVER = "DISCOVER",
  OTHER = "OTHER"
}

// For dropdown menu:
const cardTypes = Object.values(CardType);

<Select>
  {cardTypes.map(type => (
    <MenuItem key={type} value={type}>{type}</MenuItem>
  ))}
</Select>

4Ô∏è‚É£ JSON Example (API):
{
  "cardType": "VISA",
  "last4Digits": "1234",
  "companyId": 1
}

‚úÖ Summary of Card Types Enum Values:
- VISA
- MASTERCARD
- AMEX
- DISCOVER
- OTHER

üî• Would you also like me to:
Add Account Type Enums (e.g., CHECKING, SAVINGS, BUSINESS)?
Wire enums into full API examples or DB migration scripts?
Let me know, and I can prepare the next step for you!


üè∑Ô∏è Enum for Corporation Type
Here‚Äôs how it would look in different layers:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Java Backend Example (Spring Boot)
Java Enum:
public enum CorporationType {
    LLC,
    C_CORP,
    S_CORP
}
Usage in Entity:
@Entity
public class Company {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private CorporationType corporationType;

    @ManyToOne
    private ContactPerson contactPerson;

    // Other fields...
}

2Ô∏è‚É£ Database Enum:
If using PostgreSQL, you can explicitly define an ENUM type:
CREATE TYPE corporation_type AS ENUM ('LLC', 'C_CORP', 'S_CORP');

CREATE TABLE companies (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    corporation_type corporation_type,
    contact_person_id INT,
    -- other fields...
);

3Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Usage (React + TypeScript):
export enum CorporationType {
  LLC = "LLC",
  C_CORP = "C_CORP",
  S_CORP = "S_CORP"
}

// For dropdown:
const corporationTypes = Object.values(CorporationType);

<Select>
  {corporationTypes.map(type => (
    <MenuItem key={type} value={type}>{type}</MenuItem>
  ))}
</Select>

4Ô∏è‚É£ JSON Example (API):
When sending/receiving JSON:
{
  "companyName": "Acme Inc.",
  "corporationType": "LLC",
  "contactPersonId": 12
}

5Ô∏è‚É£ Validation:
In the backend (Java or Node.js), make sure to:
Validate that the input matches the enum values.
Return proper error messages if it doesn't.

‚úÖ Summary:
Corporation Types Enum Values:
- LLC
- C_CORP
- S_CORP
Would you like me to:
Add enums for Account Types & Card Types as well?
Provide a working backend + frontend project template with enums integrated?
Let me know!

üî• Next Steps:
Would you like me to:
Prepare a React project structure with AG Grid tables and form components pre-wired?
Write Spring Boot REST API endpoints for Companies, Banks, Credit Cards, Files, Transactions?
Provide a DB schema (PostgreSQL or MySQL) with migrations ready?
Add file upload & CSV parser sample in Java backend?
Let me know which part you'd like to get started on! üí™
